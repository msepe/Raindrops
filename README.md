Raindrops
=========
the mission;
Describe your game with any information you think I should have in the README. This includes any bugs/glitches you find in your program. It is better to describe them yourself than to leave them for me to find.
The game is played by catching simple blue raindrops in the bucket at the bottom of the screan. 
If you miss a raindrop then you will lose a life, you have five lives and the goal is to the reach the highes score.
The twist is the bad rain drops, these are red.
When you come in contact with one of these bad raindrops then you lose a life as well.
As your score increase the apear in higher numbers and more often.
It is not all bad though,there is a chance that you can gain a powerup. A one in twenty chance.
This power up is in the shape of a raindrop, yet bigger and blinking.
When you catch the power up then your catcher at the bottom of the screan grows to doubble the size!
After ten turns with this your powerup disapears.
Five deaths then the game is over, try to get the highest score.

One thing that I had much dificulty when makeing this game was the timmer.
I did not understand how it worked untill halfway through the final class.
My good rain drops do not take in account for a timer but the raindrop just runs all over again when it hits the bottom.
In order to account for a timer I added a new raindrop which does run on a timer.
The bad rain drops run on the timmer.

The only glitch that I noticed in my code was an error that sometimes occurs when you catch a powerup for the seccond time.
Sometimes the power up grows then imediely shrinks right after caught, giving you no powerup.
